## Why all this drama?

We do not have any commercial interest in the stuff available from
this site. Our goal is the wide distribution of the information
here. Contributions from people are greatly welcome. Ideally, we would
like to release every thing here under [public domain]. But the sad
fact is that we live in a less than perfect world. So to avoid crazy
litigation, we have copyrighted every material here.
