# Website of Armchair Conservationist

This is the source repository for the website of
the [Armchair Conservationist].

## Contributing contents.

To contribute contents you do not need to known any [jekyll] or ruby.
You just have to write an appropriate markdown file.


## Setup.

The website is hosted as a github page using [jekyll]. If you want to
preview the contents on your local machine, it would do good to
install [jekyll] on your local machine. We give a short setup
instruction for this (tested on Debian stable but should be easy to
replicate on any standard Unixes).

1. [Install rvm][rvm]

2. Setup appropriate version of ruby and gemset.

```
$ rvm install `cat .ruby-version`
$ rvm gemset create `cat .ruby-gemset`
```

3. Install bundler and the rest of the dependencies.

```
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

4. You can view this file locally as follows.

```
$ bundle exec jekyll server # starts a preview server on port 4000.
$ firefox http://127.0.0.1:4000/

```

Now you have everything need. Happy hacking.

### Why all this drama?

We do not have any commercial interest in the stuff available from
this site. Our goal is the wide distribution of the information
here. Contributions from people are greatly welcome. Ideally, we would
like to release every thing here under [public domain]. But the sad
fact is that we live in a less than perfect world. So to avoid crazy
litigation, we have copyrighted every material here.
